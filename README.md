## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using divs as flex containers, border-radius property and how to selectively style corners of images, text-decoration property to achieve strike-through effect.

### Continued development

More experience with using calc(rem/16) in CSS styling for font sizes. Using flexbox in a way that produces desired results in less time.
